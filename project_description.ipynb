    "# Project 1: Pose estimation\n",
    "## Due Jan. 30th\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem description\n",
    "One of the most common computer vision tasks, particularly for things like practical robotics, is called *pose estimation*.  *Pose* is simply the computer vision term for the vector\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{p} = [X_{cam},Y_{cam},Z_{cam},\\phi,\\theta,\\psi],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the first three elements of the vector are the position of a camera and the last three elements are its yaw, pitch, and roll.  *Pose estimation* is simply determining these values from an image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "How is this done?  Imagine that we have identified the real-world coordinates $\\mathbf{X}_i$ of several features that are easily identified, and fit in one photograph.  We'll call them ground control points (GCPs).\n",
    "<img src=\"gcp.jpg\">\n",
    "Using code that we've already developed, we can simulate where these GCPs should project to in the image.  If we already know the correct pose, when we perform this projection, the projection of the GCPs (the steeple of M, for example), should be collocated with that feature in a real image that we took with the camera.  This is a good way of ensuring that our camera model is correct.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, usually the pose is not known *a priori*.  Instead, we need to find the pose that reduces the misfit between the projection of the GCPs, and their identified location in the image.  At its core, you can think of this as a least-squares problem: adjust the pose of the model camera such that the squared difference between the projection of the GCP and its location in the image is minimized.  We can write this mathematically as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{p}_{opt} = \\mathrm{argmin}_{\\mathbf{p}} \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^2 (f(\\mathbf{X}_i,\\mathbf{p})_j - \\mathbf{u}_{ij})^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of GCPs, and $f(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{p})$ is the projection of real world coordinates $\\mathbf{X}$ into camera coordinates (which depends on the pose $\\mathbf{p}$, and $\\mathbf{u}$ is the pixel coordinates of the equivalent point in the image.  When properly formulated, this minimization problem is straightforward to solve.  The classic method for doing so is the [Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm), which is a generalization of Newton's method and Gradient descent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Software Requirements:\n",
    "Your assignment is to develop a camera model that has the capability to perform pose estimation.  It should be structured as a Python class with (at least) the following methods:\n",
    "* A method for performing the projective transform\n",
    "* A method for performing the transformation from world to generalized camera coordinates\n",
    "* A method for estimating pose, given ground control points (an excellent python implementation of Levenberg-Marquardt can be found [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html).)\n",

    "You should test this code on real world imagery of your own making.  Go out into the world and take a photograph of a scene in which you will be able to identify real world coordinates.  As an example (which you are free to emulate), I took a photograph of main hall from the oval (see above).  In the background was the M, along with a few other things.  I selected several prominent features in my image, recorded their image coordinates, then used google earth (with coordinates set to UTM mode) to determine their location in world coordinates:\n",
